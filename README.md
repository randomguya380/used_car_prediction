ML models to predict used_cars prices
Driverless cars are getting closer to reality and at a faster pace than ever. But it is still a bit far fetched dream to have one in your garage. For the time being, there are still a lot of combustion and hybrid cars that roar around the road, for some it chills. Though the overall data on sales of automobiles shows a huge drop in sales in the last couple of years, cars are still a big attraction for many. Cars are more than just a utility for many. They are often the pride and status of the family. We all have different tastes when it comes to owning a car or at least when thinking of owning one.

Well here of course as the name suggests we are not concentrating on a new car, rather our interest is in knowing the prices of used cars across the country whether it is a royal l luxury sedan or a cheap budget utility vehicle. In this hackathon, you will be predicting the costs of used cars given the data collected from various sources and distributed across various locations in India.
